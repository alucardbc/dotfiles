Intended to be used as a complement to `Linter-Puppet-Lint` to provide syntax checks in addition to `Puppet-Lint`'s style checks.\n\n### Installation\nThe `Puppet` or `Puppet Enterprise` Agent is required to be installed (preferably from a package or a gem) before using this. The `Linter` and `Language-Puppet` Atom packages are also required but should be automatically installed as dependencies thanks to steelbrain's `package-deps`.\n\n### Usage\n- Avoid specifying arguments (e.g. --debug) that greatly affect the formatting of the parser output.  These will cause issues.\n- The `Puppet` parser is slower than most executables used for linting and its errors may require several seconds after saving to display.\n- The `Puppet` parser only throws errors for the first line of errors it encounters in a manifest so this linter only displays one line of errors at a time. However. some versions of `Puppet` support multiple lines of certain errors per manifest.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/mschuchard/linter-puppet-parsing#readme","_id":"linter-puppet-parsing@1.0.4","_shasum":"24551051e2ce4ef8a448c70b4df3294758354456","_resolved":"file:../d-117026-12079-1cguvmz.8gyndeipb9/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117026-12079-1cguvmz.8gyndeipb9/package.tgz"}
